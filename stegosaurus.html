<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Stegosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur living in the late Jurassic era. Its most notable characteristics include its heavy build, large size, short fore limbs and long hind limbs, upright plates on its back, and a tail tipped with four spikes, two on each side.</p>
<p>The very first reconstructions of stegosaurus depicted it standing upright in a kangaroo-like position. It also had a long neck, and instead of plates, it had spikes on its back, while the plates were on its tail. Later reconstructions look similar to modern depictions, but the neck is thicker and the tail is at ground level, instead of high up in the air.</p>
<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p>Tracks of Stegosaurus suggest that it lived and traveled in herds, though some suggest that Stegosaurus was more of a solitary animal.</p>
<p>Stegosaurus most likely fed on plants such as ferns, horsetails, cycads, mosses, and conifers or fruits. It would've been impossible for it to graze on grasses like many herbivorous mammals today, as grass hadn't evolved yet. It's possible that Stegosaurus, like many crocodilians and herbivorous birds today, ate rocks to grind plant matter in its stomach. However, there hasn't been any fossil evidence indicating that this was the case.</p>
<p>Stegosaurus was probably preyed upon by large carnivores such as Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus.</p>
<p>It has been much debated what Stegosaurus used its back plates for. Some have suggested that they were a defensive structure, though the plates turned out to be too fragile for that purpose. Others claim that the plates might've been used to control Stegosaurus' body heat, similar to sail-backed lizards such as Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, as well as modern elephant and rabbit ears. Another theory is that they could've been used for threat display against predators. Stegosaurus would pump its plates full of blood when under threat, causing them to blush red. This would've made Stegosaurus look much larger and intimidating to predators. However, despite the presence of blood vessels in the plates, they were covered in horn rather than skin, which made this use unlikely.</p>
<p style="margin-left:680px;">Stegosaurus' brain was about the size of a dog's, which was relatively small for such a big animal. It's commonly thought that because of this, Stegosaurus was unintelligent, though its brain anatomy is so poorly known that it's not exactly known if this was true. Stegosaurus likely had an excellent sense of smell and poor eyesight.</p>
